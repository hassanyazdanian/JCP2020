In this directory, there are two benchmark tests in order to validate the
technique developed to compute the Biot-Savart integral. In both tests, the 
magnetic flux density is known analytically, and therefore the performance of
the numerical algorithm can be compared to a ground truth. The first example is
a smooth phantom, while the second phantom is piecewise smooth.
